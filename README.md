# Marutsakha
## Problem Statement
Litter in remote reserves like George Everest Peak needs efficient cleanup. Inaccessibility poses a challenge for regular cleaning, risking environmental harm. We propose using drones to accurately detect and locate garbage for targeted and efficient cleanups, preserving the pristine environment.

### What it does
Marutsakha is a unmanned ariel drone integrated with a trained ML model that can detect garbage. Marutsakha is equipped with sensors including gps and a camera. Our idea is to set a path of the drone in inacessible areas where manual reach is fuel consuming. This UAV would stream video and detect the garbage locations in path and based on drone's current position would generate a geoheatmap that can be helpful to easily map out the garbage accumulations.
